# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-CS0445-
Projects for Professor Ramirez's CS0445 course (Fall 2020)

1. **Assignment 1: Circular Array**
    - DequeInterface.java, Indexable.java, IndexableAddRemove.java -> interfaces provided by instructor
    - MyDeque.java -> written by me (implements DequeInterface.java)
    - IndexDeque.java -> written by me (implements Indexable.java)
    - IndexAddRemoveDeque.java -> written by me (implements IndexableAddRemove.java)
    
2. **Assignment 2: Implement String Builder with Linked List**
    - MyStringBuilder.java -> written by me
    
3. **Assignment 3: Recursively Implement String Builder with Linked List (also implemented simplified version of regular expression match)**
    - MyStringBuilder2.java -> written by me
    
4. **Assignment 4: Comparisson of Runtime Algorithms**
    - assig4RunTimes.xlsx -> spreadsheet comparing runtimes of different sorting algorithms for different sized tests
    - ExtraCreditRunTimes.xlsx -> runtime comparisons for shellshort with different gap sequences (in addition to the algorithms already tested)
    - SortAlgorithms.java -> filled in by me
    - Assig4ExtraCredit.java -> written by me (test shellsort with different gap sequences)
    - Assig4A.java -> tests runtimes of algorithms
